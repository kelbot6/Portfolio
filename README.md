# Portfolio

This repository consists of several documents, including my resume and reflections.

Specifically, I have included three documents from Software Engineering.  This class covered the software development cycle from gathering requirements to actually testing the project.  

The first document, Honors Requirements, involved meeting with a client to ascertain the necessary requirements for a web application to make it easier for Honors Program students to see their class tracks, since Honors classes are not tracked in the system as regular major and minor tracks.  This portion of the project involved no programming, but was vital in determining the necessary components that will need to be included in the final application.  

From this project, I learned how to clarify requirements with the client, as well to reiterate ideas to make sure that we were both on the same page.  In a real world environment, this is extremely important for the beginning stages of developing an application.  As this was a team effort, completing the document as a group really reinforced our understanding of the requirements for the web application.

My group made sure to meet regularly, as well as delegate tasks evenly to ensure our document was completed on time with all necessary components, so I would not change how we did this project.


The next document, the Usability Study, is based on a finance role playing game.  For this assignment, my team designed an interface, as well as our envisioned path through the application.  Then, each team member presented the interface to several others, both within and outside of computer science.  I asked each person to complete several tasks encompassing many of the necessary requirements we received from the requirements team.  Through each step, I asked the person to do a "think-aloud," which is when they say out loud every step they take.  By taking notes on each person's thought process, I was able to help the team refine the interface to better fit how our potential users would actually navigate the application.

From this, I learned that users often do not follow the same process as the application designers.  There were several instances where users thought almost the opposite of how we intended the application to be used, so we had to clarify and redesign as needed to make the application more intuitive for our user base.

Next time, I would conduct a larger usability study from a wider variety of disciplines to make sure I had as much diverse feedback as possible.


The final document, Use Cases, is also from the Honors Program web application.  These are based off the requirements provided by the client.  This document details how a user can access certain portions of the application, as well as alternate pathways depending on several factors.  

I learned that there can often be many different routes to one portion of an application, even if the intended pathway is relatively simple.  

Next time, I would like to do more use cases to more fully represent the possible methods to complete all tasks within the application, as this representation would allow for a better idea of designing the application.
